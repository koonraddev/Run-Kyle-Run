<h2>ABOUT PROJECT</h2>
<p>The first project created in 3D. I used a system that generates the world on an ongoing basis along with the player's progress, using previously prepared prefabs. I became familiar with the basics of ProBuilder toolkit, the DOTween library and the TextMeshPro extension.</p>
